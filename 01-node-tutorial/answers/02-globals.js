// Globals
/*
    02-globals.js: This program should use the console.log function 
    to write some globals to the screen. 
    Set an environment variable with the following command in your command line terminal: 
    export MY_VAR="Hi there!" The program should then use console.log 
    to print out the values of __dirname (a Node global variable)
    and process.env.MY_VAR (process is also a global, 
    and contains the environment variables you set in your terminal.) 
    You could print out other globals as well (Node documentation on available globals). 
    For each of these programs, you invoke them with node to make sure they work.

//export MY_VAR='Hi there!'
process.env.MY_VAR = 'Hi there!'


//console.log(MY_VAR);
console.log( __dirname)

console.log(__filename)

1. In this lesson, you created 
a middleware function called 
asyncWrapper. Why?

 - Having a asyncWrapper middleware function helps with making the code less redundat.
Since we have 5 different functions and all of them use the try{}catch(){} error handler
we can refactor our code by using the asyncWrapper middleware function. Our code is clearner.

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both
 a status code and an error message are sent back 
 to the user when they request the URL for a task
  that does not exist. Assume that you’ve created a 
  CustomAPIError class and an error handler that 
  references that class. Complete the code:

  - const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    return next(createCustomError(`No task with is ${taskID}`, 404))
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
